## Description

### Introduction

This project presents a C program, without the use of any external libraries other than the standard C libraries. The program manipulates binary files in disk storage.

### Objectives

Ten functionalities analogous to those present in real Database Management Systems were developed to manipulate a real database provided by the Secretariat of Public Security of São Paulo, containing information about cellphone thefts.

### The developed functionalities are:
1. Create table
2. Select
3. Create index
4. Select where
5. Delete
6. Insert into
7. Update
8. Create tree
9. Select where tree
10. Insert into tree

### Distribution

There were a total of 3 deliveries over 4 months, following this schedule:
1. Delivery
    - Create table
    - Select
2. Delivery
    - Create index
    - Select where
    - Delete
    - Insert into
    - Update
3. Delivery
    - Create tree
    - Select where tree
    - Insert into tree

This project is cumulative and sequential, with each functionality depending on its predecessor.

### Execution

To execute the program, first use the command to generate the executable:<br>
`make all`

Then, use the command to run the program:<br>
`make run`

Finally, choose a *.in* file to use as input or manually input the required fields.

## Conclusion

In this project, we had the opportunity to explore the inner workings of Database Management Systems and the manipulation of binary files in disk storage. It was an enriching experience, as we could better understand how DBMSs handle data at a lower level.
